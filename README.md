# RankSort-Algorithm in parallel
PLEASE NOTE THAT THIS FILE MAY NOT WORK PROPERLY WITHOUT USING THE NVIDIA CUDA TOOLKIT.

Rank sort algorithm is a sorting algorithm that sorts a list of elements by assigning each element a rank, such that the element with the rank 1 is the smallest element, the element with the rank 2 is the second smallest element, and so on.

The rank sort algorithm can be accelerated using the CUDA toolkit by running the kernel function on multiple CUDA cores in parallel. This can significantly improve the performance of the algorithm, especially for large datasets.
